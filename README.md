## To-Do List Programming

* [ ] Put a button on the screen an label it "Hit Me!"
* [ ] When the player presses the Hit Me! button, the app has to show an alert pop-up to inform the player how well he or she did. Somehow, you have to calculate the score and put that into this alert.
* [ ] Put text on the screen, such as the “Score:” and “Round:” labels. Some of this text changes over time; for example, the score, which increases when the player scores points.
* [ ] Put a slider on the screen with a range between the values 1 and 100.
* [ ] Read the value of the slider after the user presses the Hit Me! button.
* [ ] Generate a random number at the start of each round and display it on the screen. This is the target value.
* [ ] Compare the value of the slider to that random number and calculate a score based on how far off the player is. You show this score in the alert pop-up.
* [ ] Put the Start Over button on the screen. Make it reset the score and put the player back to the first round.
* [ ] Put the app in landscape orientation.
* [ ] Make it look pretty.
